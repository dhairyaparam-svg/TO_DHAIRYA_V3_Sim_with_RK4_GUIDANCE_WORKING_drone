# Item Definition - ISO 26262 (.itm)

## Overview
Defines **ISO 26262 item definition** with system boundaries and operating modes. Part of ISO 26262 Part 3 compliance.

## File Structure
- **ONE** `hdef itemdefinition` per file
- **MULTIPLE** `def boundary` and `def operatingmode` statements (hierarchical)
- Can `use` featuresets

## Valid Keywords
```
use, hdef, itemdefinition, def, boundary, operatingmode, name, description, 
owner, tags, level, iso26262part, safetylevel, conditions, includes, 
excludes, itemscope, when, ref
```

## Syntax Structure
```
use featureset [featureset-ref]

hdef itemdefinition [identifier]
  name [string-literal]
  description [string-literal]
  owner [string-literal]
  tags [string-literal], [string-literal], ...
  iso26262part [string-literal]
  safetylevel [ASIL-A|ASIL-B|ASIL-C|ASIL-D|QM]

  def boundary [identifier]
    name [string-literal]
    description [string-literal]
    includes ref block [block-ref], [block-ref], ...
    excludes ref block [block-ref], [block-ref], ...
    
    def boundary [sub-boundary-id]
      # Nested boundaries with same structure
      
  def operatingmode [identifier]
    name [string-literal]
    description [string-literal]
    conditions [string-literal]
    itemscope [string-literal]
```

```

## Boundary Relationships
- `includes ref block` - Blocks included in boundary
- `excludes ref block` - Blocks excluded from boundary
- Hierarchical boundaries supported

## Operating Mode Properties
- `conditions` - Operating conditions (string)
- `safetylevel` - ASIL level for this mode
- Hierarchical modes supported
