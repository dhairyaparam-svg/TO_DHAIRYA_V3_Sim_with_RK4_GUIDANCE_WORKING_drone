# Agent Definition (.agt)

## Overview
Defines **AI agents** with specialized expertise for systems engineering tasks.

## File Structure
- **ONE** `hdef agentset` per file
- **MULTIPLE** `def agent` statements

## Valid Keywords
```
use, hdef, agentset, def, agent, name, description, owner, role, 
specialization, expertise, context
```

## Syntax Structure
```
hdef agentset [identifier]
  name [string-literal]
  description [string-literal]
  owner [string-literal]

  def agent [identifier]
    name [string-literal]
    description [string-literal]
    role [string-literal]
    specialization [string-literal]
    expertise [string-literal]
    context [string-literal]
```
