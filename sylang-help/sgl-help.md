## Safety Goal Properties

### Required Properties

- `name` - Concise safety goal statement
- `description` - Detailed safety goal (use triple quotes for multiline)
- `safetylevel` - ASIL level inherited from hazard
- `derivedfrom ref hazard` - Source hazard(s) (multiple allowed)
- `safestate` - Safe state description (multiline supported)

### Timing Properties (ISO 26262 Part 3)

- `faulttoleranttime` - Maximum time to detect and react (milliseconds)
- `emergencyoperationtime` - Time system can operate in degraded mode (milliseconds)

### Traceability

- **Backward**: `derivedfrom ref hazard/situation`, `mitigates ref hazard`
- **Forward**: `leadsto ref requirement` (links to `.req` file, multiple allowed)
- **Scope**: `allocatedto ref item` (links to `.itm` file)

## Relationship Rules

### From `.haz` (Hazard Analysis) → `.sgl` (Safety Goals)

```sylang
### In .haz file:
def hazard UnintendedAcceleration
  severity S3
  exposure E4
  controllability C2
  asil ASIL-D

### In .sgl file:
def safetygoal SG_001_PreventUnintendedAcceleration
  derivedfrom ref hazard UnintendedAcceleration
  safetylevel ASIL-D  # Inherited from hazard
```

### From `.sgl` (Safety Goals) → `.req` (Requirements) - Bilateral Traceability

```sylang
### In .sgl file:
def safetygoal SG_001_PreventUnintendedAcceleration
  leadsto ref requirement REQ_SAFE_ACCEL_001, REQ_SAFE_ACCEL_002

### In .req file (bilateral traceability):
def requirement REQ_SAFE_ACCEL_001
  reqtype safety
  safetylevel ASIL-D
  derivedfrom ref safetygoal SG_001_PreventUnintendedAcceleration
  # ... requirement details
  
def requirement REQ_SAFE_ACCEL_002
  reqtype functional
  safetylevel ASIL-D
  derivedfrom ref safetygoal SG_001_PreventUnintendedAcceleration
  # ... requirement details
```

**Note**: `.req` files must use `derivedfrom ref safetygoal` to establish bilateral traceability.

## ASIL Inheritance

Safety goals inherit ASIL level from their source hazards:

- Hazard ASIL-D → Safety Goal ASIL-D
- Hazard ASIL-C → Safety Goal ASIL-C
- Multiple hazards → Highest ASIL applies

## Safe State Types (Examples)

```
1. """Controlled stop in current lane"""
2. """Degraded operation with reduced speed"""
3. """Driver takeover with warning"""
4. """Minimal risk condition with safe stop"""
5. """Emergency operation using redundant systems"""
```

## Validation Rules

✅ Exactly one `hdef safetygoalset` per file
✅ Must `use hazardanalysis` to reference hazards
✅ Each safety goal must have `derivedfrom ref hazard`
✅ Each safety goal must have `safestate` definition
✅ `faulttoleranttime` and `emergencyoperationtime` recommended
✅ ASIL level must match or be higher than source hazard
✅ `leadsto ref requirement` links to `.req` file (multiple allowed)
❌ Cannot create safety goals without source hazards
❌ Cannot lower ASIL level from source hazard

## ISO 26262 Compliance Notes

- **Part 3, Clause 6**: Safety goals derived from hazard analysis
- **Part 3, Clause 7**: Safe state definition required
- **Part 3, Clause 8**: FTTI (Fault Tolerant Time Interval) specification
- **Part 3, Clause 9**: Forward traceability to safety requirements

**Next Steps**:

- Create safety requirements in `.req` files with `reqtype safety`
- Link requirements back with `derivedfrom ref safetygoal`
- Generate ISO 26262 Part 3 documentation report
