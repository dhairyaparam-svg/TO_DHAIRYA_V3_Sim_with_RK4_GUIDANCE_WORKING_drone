# State Machine Diagram (.smd)

## Overview
Defines **state machines** with states, transitions, and behavioral logic. Requires ONE initialstate=true and ONE endstate=true per file.

## File Structure
- **ONE** `hdef statemachine` per file
- **MULTIPLE** `def state` and `def transition` statements
- ONE state with `initialstate true`
- ONE state with `endstate true`

## Valid Keywords
```
use, hdef, statemachine, def, state, transition, name, description, owner, 
tags, safetylevel, status, allocatedto, implements, initialstate, endstate, 
from, to, condition, call, when, ref
```

## Syntax Structure
```
use functionset [functionset-ref]
use requirementset [requirementset-ref]
use block [block-ref]

hdef statemachine [identifier]
  name [string-literal]
  description [string-literal]
  owner [string-literal]
  tags [string-literal], [string-literal], ...
  safetylevel [ASIL-A|ASIL-B|ASIL-C|ASIL-D|QM]
  status [draft|approved|implemented]
  allocatedto ref block [block-ref]
  implements ref requirement [requirement-ref]

  def state [identifier]
    name [string-literal]
    description [string-literal]
    owner [string-literal]
    status [draft|implemented|verified]
    initialstate [true|false]
    endstate [true|false]
    implements ref requirement [requirement-ref]
    
  def transition [identifier]
    name [string-literal]
    description [string-literal]
    from ref state [state-ref]
    to ref state [state-ref]
    condition [string-literal]
    call ref function [function-ref]
```

```

## Required States
- **Initial State**: ONE state with `initialstate true`
- **End State**: ONE state with `endstate true`

## State Properties
- `initialstate true` - Entry point of state machine
- `endstate true` - Exit/fault state
- `status` - Implementation status

## Transition Properties
- `from ref state` - Source state
- `to ref state` - Target state
- `condition` - Guard condition (string expression)
- `call ref function` - Function to execute on transition

---
State machines must have exactly ONE initial state and ONE end state.
